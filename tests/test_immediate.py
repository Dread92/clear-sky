"""A filter that a weapon outruns is not a filter.

Somebody sets "alert me about things within 10 km". For a Shahed that is a real setting: three minutes of
warning, and a dozen irrelevant alerts a night spared. For an Iskander-M it is a trap — the missile crosses
that ring in under four seconds, so the condition "within 10 km of you" is only ever true after it has
arrived. The filter does not filter; it silently deletes the one warning there was, and the person never
learns the setting did that.

So these types ignore every radius and concern the whole region, and they say so in those words — never with
a distance or an ETA, both of which would invite the reader to believe there is time.
