"""What a mark on the map says without being read.

A silhouette is read before any label is. That makes it the fastest thing on the screen and the easiest one
to lie with: a pointed shape is read as a heading whether or not anybody reported one, and a shape that
moves is read as observed motion whether or not anything was observed. Both of those were happening.

So: a mark turns only along a course the post actually reported, and stays upright when there is none;
nothing animates; and each weapon has a shape of its own rather than borrowing a neighbour's.
