"""The four places somebody watches, and the promise that they stay on the phone.

One of the four is a school. A row in a database saying "this person's child is at these coordinates on
weekday mornings" is not a thing this app gets to create, whatever it would buy — and the way that row gets
created is never a decision, it is a `name` field quietly riding along in a request body that somebody added
for debugging. So the test is not "does the server store it": it is "does it ever leave the phone at all".

The rest is the filtering around that place. Two rules run through all of it: a course the app inferred is
never treated as a course the source reported, and "we do not know" is never rendered as "not coming".
