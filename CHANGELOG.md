# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-16

First tagged version: the app as it runs today.

### Coverage
- All of Ukraine: 27 oblasts, 136 raions, 36 Telegram channels including the city-siren network,
  єТривога and єРадар.
- Kyiv has its own simplified 10-district map from OSM boundaries.
- Crimea drawn hatched as temporarily occupied, with a pixel-art Cossack and a waving flag.

### Map
- Oblast-wide alerts always paint the whole oblast; raion alerts can only add to them.
- Shaheds drawn loitering with a heading chevron; no trajectory extrapolation unless EST is on;
  no ETA anywhere.
- Co-located targets cluster into one glyph with a count badge; labels de-collide in screen space;
  off-screen targets get edge indicators.
- Stale targets go grey with a `?`, fade in steps and disappear after 15 minutes.
- Street and building tiles from OSM below 150 km width.
- History layer: explosions ✸ and confirmed shoot-downs ✕ over 24 / 48 / 72 h.

### Warnings
- Preventive banner for MiG-31K take-off and ballistic threats, with cancellation and a 20-minute
  cap.
- Nightly threat *assessments* are classified as forecasts: they never raise the banner and never
  place a marker. Stored posts from the last 6 hours are re-tagged at startup.
- Missile mode: 5-second refresh while a ballistic or cruise-missile threat is open.
- Web Push (VAPID / RFC 8291) for the watched oblast and the chosen place.

### Interface
- Full UI in English, Ukrainian and French, including place, raion, district and channel names.
- The entry screen asks for the language, the oblast and, optionally, a precise place to watch.
- Compact status band; scrolling ticker with the basic rules; disclaimer on every open.
- Stats: alerts per day and by time of day, longest alert, explosions and shoot-downs by oblast, and
  what the Air Force reported as launched over Ukraine (24 h / 7 d / 30 d) — kept separate from the
  count of monitoring reports.

### Project
- Restructured into `app/` + `static/` + `tests/` + `docs/`, with VS Code configuration, pytest
  suite, ruff, GitHub Actions CI and an optional Fly.io deploy workflow.
